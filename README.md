BeagleBone Black Proto Cape
===========================

This repository contains the Eagle design files for the LGX Proto Cape for the BeagleBone Black.  

Check out the LGX Proto Cape at http://www.logicsupply.com/products/cbb_proto  


**NOTE**: On CBB-Proto r01 the **SYS5V** and **VDD5V** labels are reversed. This is only
a concern if drawing higher currents from the 5V rail, or when supplying power 
to the BeagleBone through the proto cape instead of the DC barrel jack. In 
both cases the bus labelled **SYS5V** should be used, as it is connected directly 
to the BeagleBone's DC input.
